asciiCalc evalStr() should not ignore return

SeExprNode
  getStrArg() does not belong on base SeExprNode. We use this in SeExprPlugins, but there should be a better way of looking for that
// Do we need to check the value of string arg of custom function? Shouldn't
// it be done at runtime and fail in eval stage?

SeExprPlugins
  Arguments for in tangent and out tangent don't check they are constant string. Also, do we want ot make this work
  foo="constant";  animCurve(foo,"fds"); (i.e. the first argument is not a SeExprStr as your current code assumes)
// in tangent and out tangent are checked as varying string before. now changed to checked as constant string.

The trim function seems unused. Can we delete it?
// deleted.

PromoteBinaryOperands should perhaps return a std::pair of value*'s instead of mutating the incoming ones
// done

The prmoting of values for binary operands compares its arguments like 3 times. Maybe there is a way to clean that up
// isLegaltoPromote are now removed. It is simplified to check if destType is vector.

Is resolveLocalVar correct. What if it needs to look in a different basic block. What are the variable resolution rules?
// Are local var are alloca'd in entry basic block. Only when codegen assignment, local var may be alloca'd.
// case like $m = 1.0; $m=$m * [1,2,3] cause a new vector version of m to be alloca'd. No other cases incur local var alloca

Select does not work on SeExprCond needs to be fixed
// fixed.


--- testing
    make a script that runs all of our tests and returns exit code 0 if pass,
      this should probably be python
    exit code 1 if fails
    make a script that runs all imageSynth tests with the interprett and with llvm
    add all of your basic tests to your test suite and also a type checking test
    suite TypeTester.cpp.

--- ensure that the output is clean when evaluating, no debugging on by default

--- write documentation and add it to the documentation folder in the repo in
    docs/summer_documentation2

--- Fix time frame stuff use voodoo $frame in expression

--- SeExprPlugins should be integrated into the existing SeExprPlugins...
