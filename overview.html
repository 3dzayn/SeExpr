Arithmetic expressions appear in almost every animation system ever
created. Being able to embed an expression language in a piece of custom
software allows an amazing degree of artistic freedom. At Disney artists have
enjoyed using expressions because they allow just enough flexibility without
being overwhelming to non-programmer users. Developers have enjoyed them too for
quick prototyping and deployment of fixes to production needs.


<h2>History</h2>

<p>
At Disney there have been various expression languages. SeExpr started as a
language for our procedural geometry instancing tool, XGen. Work was done to
generalize it into something that could be used in other contexts. Later it was
integrated into paint3d, our texture painting facility, which opened the door to
procedural synthesis. More recently, we have integrated it as a way of defining
procedural controls to physical dynamical simulations and render time particle
instancing.</p>

Expressions can be seen as a way of allowing customization of inner loops. This
is contrast to scripting which is mostly aimed at gluing large parts of code
base together. So in this sense, C++ forms the center of your application,
python could be used to put pieces of it together, and SeExpr is used to
customize tight inner loops. </p>


<h2>Major Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Arithmetic expression of scalar/vector types
<li>Large library of built-in functions
<li>Extensible variables and functions (including with DSOs)
<li>Simple to embed in any program
<li>High-level UI components to manipulate and visualize expressions:
          <ul>
            <li>an expression editor, with auto-completion
            <li>a panel for control widgets, eg, sliders, ramp widgets, color widgets
            <li>an image previewer
            <li>an expression library browser
          </ul>
</ul>
